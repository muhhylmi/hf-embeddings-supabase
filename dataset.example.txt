Vibe coding is a software development practice where large language models (LLMs) are used to generate code from natural language prompts. 
It emphasizes quickly building applications and features by describing desired functionality rather than writing explicit code. 
While it can accelerate development and make coding more accessible, it also raises concerns about code understanding, potential errors, 
and the impact on traditional software engineering roles. 


Vibe coding tools are AI-powered coding assistants that enable developers to code more intuitively using natural language prompts. 
These tools leverage large language models (LLMs) to understand intent and generate code, 
allowing for a more conversational and fluid coding experience. Key platforms in this category include Cursor, 
Windsurf, Replit, and Lovable
